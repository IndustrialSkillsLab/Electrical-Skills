# Module 1: Basic Electrical Circuits

## Segment 1: Fundamentals of Electricity

### Objective 1: Define Electricity and Give an Application
Electricity is the flow of electrons (tiny charged particles) through wires—like water moving through pipes.

**Application:** Turning on a lamp lets electricity light up your room.

### Objective 2: Describe Two Types of Electrical Current and Give an Application of Each
- **Direct Current (DC):** Flows one way (batteries—phones, flashlights).
- **Alternating Current (AC):** Changes direction, like waves (wall outlets—microwaves, TVs).

**Example:** Toys use DC; refrigerators use AC.

### Objective 3: Describe the Function and Operation of a Circuit Tester
A circuit tester checks if electricity is present—like a detective looking for power.  
**Example:** Plug into an outlet to see if it works.

## Segment 2: Electrical Circuit Components

### Objective 4: Describe the Function of Four Basic Components of a Circuit
- **Power Source:** Provides energy (battery, wall outlet).
- **Conductors:** Carry electricity (wires).
- **Load:** Uses energy (lights, motors).
- **Control Devices:** Turn electricity on/off (switch).

**Analogy:** Like a water park—pump, pipes, fountains, valves.
